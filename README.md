# Buck-DC-Chopper
A buck or step-down converter is a DC/DC switch mode power supply designed to buck (or lower) an unregulated DC supply's input voltage to a stabilized lower output voltage. Buck converters are highly appreciated for their extraordinarily high efficiency, which can easily surpass 95% when compared to ordinary voltage regulators.
